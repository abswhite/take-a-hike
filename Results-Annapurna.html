  <h3>Memorable quote:</h3>
  <blockquote>“We slept like a dead and knew nothing. Early morning there came some friends from another camp to congratulate and express their heartfelt condolence. We were in sorrow, we were tired and still we wanted to rescue our casualties but it was not easy and not possible from that point. Aerial rescue was not possible to that height and getting to that area by climbing means putting more lives in danger.” <br><cite>--Excerpt from Mingma Sherpa’s Annapurna Diary, March 27, 2015</cite></blockquote>
